Brainstorming ideas for what to use database for:

    - Chess database
        Store multiple games, reference them, find the move that led to the most wins, see which openings led to the most wins, etc.
        
        Game object:
            List<Move> moves
            String outcome ("white win", "black win", "stalemate", "draw by repitition", "draw by insufficient material", etc.)
        
        Move object:
            int moveNumber
            String color ("White", "Black")
            String notation (proper chess notation)

        Relational database:
            one game includes multiple moves (obviously)
            one move can be involved with multiple games (e.g. many games start with e4)

        Maybe code a working chess game that utilizes the database
